# Student Project - Free Code Camp
Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/wGqEga/.

## Project Criteria:
* Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
* User Story: I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.
* User Story: I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.
* Hint #1: Here's a URL you can use to get a random Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random.
* Hint #2: Here's an entry on using Wikipedia's API: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page.
* Hint #3: Use this link to experiment with Wikipedia's API.
* Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.
* When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.
* You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
